# 7 Skills

*Bioinformatics & Computer Programming Skills*

- R, R is the language I use most day to day and I now have a high level of competence in this language and its ecosystem, such as RStudio, Rnotebooks, the ‘tidyverse’ packages and their philosophy for data manipulation along with data visualisation in ggplot2, and use of Bioconductor packages. I also have some experience with R package development and creation of interactive Shiny apps.
- Perl5, Perl has the backronym ‘pathologically eclectic rubbish lister’ for a reason it is very useful at wrangling relatively unstructured data into structures that will play nice with R.
- Linux systems, CLI / BASH scripting.
- High performance computing clusters, I have experience using HPCs with SLURM, PBS/TORQUE schedulers.
- Use of a variety of sequencing and array based analysis pipelines, most experienced with DNA methylation analysis pipelines.
- Some familiarity with but not a regular user of:
	- Python (and associated data science libraries such as Pandas, plotly, matplotlib, etc.)
	- MySQL (Including Database design and creation)
	- PHP
	- CSS/HTML/javascript
	- Perl6 

*‘Wet’ Lab Skills*
- Prior to switching emphasis to bioinformatics I acquired some experience with a variety of common ‘wet’ lab techniques including: Several forms of molecular cloning, DNA and RNA extraction and purification, PCR, acrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis, basic chromatographic protein purification and hanging drop vapour diffusion crystallisation, and simple cell culture with transfection, staining and light microscopy.
